# Clinical Prompt Engineering with Falcon-RW-1B

This project demonstrates **iterative prompt engineering** for clinical decision support using the **Falcon-RW-1B** language model loaded locally.

It runs multiple variants of a prompt to evaluate which phrasing yields the most useful output from the model. This is especially useful for clinical applications such as diagnosis generation, treatment planning, and differential diagnosis.
